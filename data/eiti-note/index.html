                <h3>Instructions for EITI data collection process</h3>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>

                <p>The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
                member and candidate states produce yearly reports
                containing various bits of information in them. Among this
                is data on different extractive industries, government and
                company revenues, taxes paid and so on. Unfortunately the
                data is all scattered and in different formats. This is
                where you come in.</p>

                <h5>Getting the Data Out</h5>
                <p>We need to get a few pieces of interesting data out of
                each report (if it is there) and into the spreadsheet
                we’ve prepared:

                <br />
                <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/a/rewiredstate.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApH8M1vWVDPGdERxNXZlTTlKcnhvcC1sS1A3TmpRSWc#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/a/rewiredstate.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApH8M1vWVDPGdERxNXZlTTlKcnhvcC1sS1A3TmpRSWc#gid=0</a> 

                <br />
                Don’t be intimidated. The Spreadsheet looks like a monster
                but don’t be afraid &#8212; a lot of it is already pre-populated
                by Revenue Watch. We will walk you through filling the
                spreadsheet &#8212; so don’t worry.</p>

                <h5>Walkthrough filling the spreadsheet</h5>
                <p>Each row in the spreadsheet corresponds to one
                record.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the report the record corresponds to (If it’s not
                    in the pdf download column, you can find it here:
                    http://eiti.org/document/eitireports)</li>

                    <li>Set the Processed field to “Yes” to indicate you’re
                    working on this report. (Do this with the small grey
                    triangle pointing down)</li>
                    
                    <li>Check whether the Report is in English and set the value
                    in the respective Column.</li>

                    <li>Go through all the columns and try to answer the questions
                    (most are Yes/No questions) and identify the values needed
                    from the report. You’ll see a lot is already prefilled as
                    we’re building on Revenue Watch’s report</li>

                    <li>Some Information: e.g. Information of individual
                    Resources/Companies go into their own sheet: For this
                    please _always_ mention the Id of the report (second
                    column) and create a new row for each
                    commodity/company</li>

                    <li>If you can’t find values or an answer &#812; don’t worry and
                    don’t force it. Just leave the field empty. </li>
                <ol>
